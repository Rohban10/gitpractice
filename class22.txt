### Ques- why git and github?
In central repository everything is updated time to time done by devoloper.
Devoloper change the code.so Each devoloper pull from central repository.
There are some term like pull,push,merge,commit.
when you work in the team then we need to use github and git.
github account is a central repository.one kind of tool.
Other tool - SVN, Bitbucket, Gitlab,TFS (paid tool).
If you learn git that help commit,merge. other are more or less same.
Version controll of code.
you can check in google.
git bash is like command prompt.(check in google).
git is a version controll. and github is repository.
repository can change but git will common. 
git is open source that is why all company use it.
commit mean put your code in repository.
make a folder - git practice.
go github account and make a new repository.
for that go new-gitpractice in repository name.

=====
To get the file in the vs code write-
git pull origin main
now we make -git ignore file
add file and create a new file and write .gitignore and select template as python
git pull origin main
now in python to create an enviroment we write=
conda create -p myenv python==3.12
to push it repository because it is a huge file,
open .gitignore and add in the environment- myenv/
now write git add.
git status
what ever file you want to ignore just write the name there
to clone(copy and make replica) - git practice- make a folder clone repo
go command prompt- go to E:
cd path
git clone repository name(repository name - go code-copy path of repo name)
for any project you need to make a clone and start working
 Now if i update(write) RAEDME.md and go vs code we see no update is there and i also write something
 git add.
 git commit-m "Again i write a line "
 now if i push
 git push origin main
